## üé® More Colors

Ethan Schoonover originally created the [Solarized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized) color scheme in 2011, featuring a set of 16 colors.
However, this assortment of colors falls short in providing adequate variations for additional signs, alerts, tooltips, and various other UI components made available by recent Neovim plugins.
Furthermore, the text colors in the original theme are somewhat too dark when displayed on modern, vibrant monitors.

Solarized Nyx improves upon this by introducing additional colors, enriching the overall theme to ensure compatibility with newer plugins and enhancing visibility on contemporary monitors.
The theme brightens the base colors slightly, creating a visually appealing and functional color palette.

Here is what the improved color palette looks like:
